=============

Android NDK application test using a native activity, OpenSL ES and OpenGL ES.

Please note that this is a WIP and intended to be used as a starting point for 100% native code. 

There are many issues that need to be addressed and many things that are done plain wrong - such as pointing entire wave data buffers into a buffer queue, instead of having a fixed buffer size.

Use at your own risk! Having said that, it should hopefully provide a base to get things started. 

To do: an official version, that reads an asset (or file from SD), and plays it with a continously streaming buffer (how things should be done for a game/musical instrument).
